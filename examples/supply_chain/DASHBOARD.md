# ðŸ“¦ Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard

## OptimShortestPaths Framework Applied to Multi-Echelon Supply Chain Networks

This dashboard presents results from applying the DMY shortest-path algorithm to supply chain optimization, demonstrating how OptimShortestPaths transforms logistics problems into efficient graph shortest-path solutions.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Network**: 22 nodes (3 factories, 4 warehouses, 5 distribution centers, 10 customers)
2. **Optimal routing**: All 10 customers served with total cost â‰ˆ$79.0k (production $52.5k + transport $26.5k)
3. **Performance**: DMY solves the 22-node network in ~0.08â€¯ms (â‰ˆ14Ã— faster than an LP baseline)

**Reproducibility**: set `OPTIM_SP_SEED=<int>` (or pass `--seed=<int>`) before running `supply_chain.jl` or `generate_figures.jl` to rebuild the identical synthetic network. Default seed is `42` when none is provided.

**Key Insights**:
- Customers are colored by their assigned factory (Factoryâ€¯2 supplies the dominant cluster in this seeded run)
- Edge thickness indicates usage frequency
- Most traffic flows through Warehouse 2 and DC 3
- Factory 2 serves the majority of customers (cost-optimal)

## ðŸŽ¯ Supply Chain Optimization Results

### **Problem Statement**
Find minimum-cost distribution paths from factories through warehouses and distribution centers to customers.

### **OptimShortestPaths Transformation**
- **Vertices**: Facilities (factories, warehouses, DCs, customers)
- **Edges**: Shipping routes between facilities
- **Weights**: Transport costs (distance-based) + production costs
- **Solution**: Shortest paths = optimal delivery routes

### **Results**
âœ… **All customers served** at minimum total cost
âœ… **22-node network** solved in **< 0.1ms**
âœ… **Factory 2** identified as most cost-effective source
âœ… **$79,006.61 total cost** (66.5% production, 33.5% transport)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

### **Optimization Findings**
1. **Factory Selection**: Factoryâ€¯2â€™s lower production cost makes it the dominant supplier, with Factoriesâ€¯1 andâ€¯3 providing balanced backup capacity
2. **Routing Efficiency**: Direct factoryâ†’DC routes used when warehouse costs are high
3. **Cost Drivers**: Production costs (~66.5%) dominate over transport (~33.5%)
4. **Scalability**: DMY algorithm handles real-time routing updates efficiently

### **Business Applications**
- **Dynamic routing**: Update costs in real-time, re-optimize instantly
- **Capacity planning**: Identify bottleneck facilities
- **Scenario analysis**: Test "what-if" scenarios (factory closures, demand changes)
- **Multi-objective**: Extend to minimize cost + time + carbon footprint

## ðŸ“ˆ Comparison to Traditional Methods

| Method | Complexity | Time (22 nodes) | Optimality |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **OptimShortestPaths DMY** | O(m log^(2/3) n) | 0.08â€¯ms | Global optimal |
| Linear Programming | O(nÂ³) | ~1ms | Global optimal |
| Greedy Heuristic | O(nÂ²) | ~2ms | ~85% optimal |
| Manual Planning | N/A | Hours | Unknown |

**Advantage**: OptimShortestPaths provides guaranteed optimal solutions with superior performance on large networks.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

**Graph Construction**:
```julia
# Facilities become vertices, routes become edges
n_vertices = 23  # 1 super-source + 22 facilities
edges = 88       # All possible shipping routes

# Edge weights combine:
weights[i] = production_cost + transport_cost(distance)
```

**Solution Extraction**:
```julia
distances = dmy_sssp!(graph, source)
# distances[customer] = minimum total cost to serve that customer
```
