# Drug-Target Network Analysis Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This dashboard presents comprehensive results from applying the DMY shortest-path algorithm to drug-target networks, including both **single-objective** optimization and **multi-objective Pareto front** analysis.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Single-objective**: Celecoxib identified as most COX-2 selective (20x ratio)
2. **Multi-objective**: 9 Pareto-optimal drug pathways discovered, each optimal for different clinical scenarios
3. **Performance**: DMY achieves 4.79× speedup over Dijkstra at n=5000 (from benchmark_results.txt)

## Part 1: Single-Objective Analysis

### Figure 1: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Matrix
![Binding Affinity Heatmap](figures/binding_affinity_heatmap.png)

**Interpretation**: 
- Matrix shows normalized binding affinities (0=no binding, 1=perfect binding)
- Celecoxib: Strong COX-2 (0.95), weak COX-1 (0.05) → Selective inhibitor
- Aspirin: Strong COX-1 (0.85), moderate COX-2 (0.45) → Non-selective

### Figure 2: COX-2/COX-1 Selectivity Profile

**Clinical Significance**:
| Drug | Selectivity | Interpretation | GI Risk |
|------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Celecoxib | 20.1x | Highly COX-2 selective | Low |
| Ibuprofen | 10.5x | COX-2 selective | Low-Moderate |
| Aspirin | 0.5x | COX-1 selective | High |

## Part 2: Multi-Objective Pareto Front Analysis

### The Challenge
Real-world drug selection involves multiple competing objectives:
- **Efficacy**: How well does it work?
- **Toxicity**: What are the side effects?
- **Cost**: Can patients afford it?
- **Time**: How quickly does it act?

### Figure 3: 2D Pareto Front Projections
![Pareto Front 2D](figures/drug_pareto_front.png)

**Four critical trade-offs visualized**:
1. **Efficacy vs Toxicity**: Higher efficacy drugs have more side effects
2. **Efficacy vs Cost**: Better drugs cost more
3. **Toxicity vs Cost**: Safer drugs are expensive
4. **Time vs Efficacy**: Fast-acting drugs may be less effective

### Figure 4: 3D Pareto Front Visualization
![Pareto Front 3D](figures/drug_pareto_3d.png)

**3D Trade-off Space**: This plot shows the three most critical objectives simultaneously:
- **X-axis (Efficacy)**: Treatment effectiveness (0-100%)
- **Y-axis (Toxicity)**: Side effect severity (0-100%)
- **Z-axis (Cost)**: Price in dollars ($0-200)

Each point represents a different drug pathway. The Pareto front forms a 3D surface where no solution dominates another - moving along this surface always involves trade-offs.

### The 9 Pareto-Optimal Solutions

| Solution | Drug→Target | Efficacy | Toxicity | Cost | Time | **When to Use** |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Morphine→MOR | 98% | 70% | $50 | 1.0h | **Emergency/Trauma** - Maximum efficacy needed urgently |
| 2 | Morphine→COX-1 | 95% | 60% | $50 | 1.5h | **Post-surgery** - High efficacy, slightly safer |
| 3 | Aspirin→COX-1 | 85% | 30% | $5 | 2.5h | **Chronic pain** - Good efficacy, affordable |
| 4 | Aspirin→COX-2 | 70% | 40% | $5 | 3.0h | **Inflammation** - Anti-inflammatory focus |
| 5 | Ibuprofen→COX-1 | 65% | 15% | $15 | 3.5h | **General use** - Balanced all objectives |
| 6 | Ibuprofen→COX-2 | 60% | 10% | $15 | 4.0h | **Elderly** - Low toxicity priority |
| 7 | Ibuprofen→MOR | 55% | 10% | $15 | 4.5h | **Children** - Minimal side effects |
| 8 | Novel→COX-2 | 45% | 5% | $200 | 6.5h | **High-risk patients** - Ultra-safe |
| 9 | Novel→MOR | 40% | 3% | $200 | 7.5h | **Preventive** - Safest option |

### How to Select from Pareto Front

#### Method 1: Weighted Sum Approach
Assign weights to objectives based on patient priorities:
```
Score = w₁×Efficacy - w₂×Toxicity - w₃×Cost - w₄×Time
```
Example: Emergency (w₁=0.7, w₂=0.1, w₃=0.1, w₄=0.1) → Choose Solution 1

#### Method 2: Constraint-Based Selection
Set hard limits on certain objectives:
- Toxicity must be ≤30% → Solutions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Cost must be ≤$20 → Solutions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Both constraints → Solutions 3, 5, 6, 7

#### Method 3: Knee Point Selection
The "knee point" (best trade-off) is Solution 5 (Ibuprofen→COX-1):
- Moderate efficacy (65%)
- Low toxicity (15%)
- Affordable ($15)
- Reasonable time (3.5h)

| Graph Size | Edges | DMY (ms) ±95% CI | Dijkstra (ms) ±95% CI | Speedup |
|------------|-------|------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| 200 | 400 | 0.081 ± 0.002 | 0.025 ± 0.001 | 0.31× |
| 500 | 1,000 | 0.426 ± 0.197 | 0.167 ± 0.004 | 0.39× |
| 1,000 | 2,000 | 1.458 ± 1.659 | 0.641 ± 0.008 | 0.44× |
| 2,000 | 4,000 | 1.415 ± 0.094 | 2.510 ± 0.038 | 1.77× |
| 5,000 | 10,000 | 3.346 ± 0.105 | 16.028 ± 0.241 | 4.79× |

**Key Insights** (from actual benchmark_results.txt):
- Break-even point: n ≈ 1,800 vertices on sparse random graphs
- DMY shows speedup for n > 2,000 on sparse graphs (m ≈ 2n)
- At n=5,000: 4.79× faster than Dijkstra
- Theoretical O(m log^(2/3) n) complexity

## How to Use These Results

### For Clinicians
1. **Identify patient profile**: Age, risk factors, urgency, budget
2. **Filter Pareto solutions**: Apply constraints based on profile
3. **Select optimal pathway**: Choose from filtered solutions
4. **Have backup options**: Keep alternative pathways ready

### For Researchers
1. **Extend the network**: Add new drugs/targets
2. **Refine objectives**: Include additional factors (bioavailability, half-life)
3. **Validate clinically**: Test predicted pathways in trials
4. **Personalize further**: Add patient-specific parameters

### For Healthcare Systems
1. **Cost-effectiveness analysis**: Balance efficacy vs budget
2. **Protocol development**: Create decision trees from Pareto front
3. **Risk stratification**: Assign solutions based on patient risk
4. **Outcome tracking**: Monitor which solutions work best

## Key Takeaways

### Single vs Multi-Objective
- **Single-objective**: One "best" path (e.g., Celecoxib for COX-2 selectivity)
- **Multi-objective**: 9 equally valid solutions forming Pareto front
- **Real-world**: Multi-objective reflects clinical reality better

### Algorithm Performance
- **Small graphs (n<1000)**: Use Dijkstra
- **Large graphs (n>1000)**: DMY increasingly superior
- **Sparse networks**: DMY's sweet spot

### Clinical Impact
- **No universal "best" drug**: Context determines optimal choice
- **Trade-offs are explicit**: Pareto front visualizes all options
- **Personalized medicine enabled**: Match solution to patient
