# Drug-Target Interaction Network Analysis

## 🌟 Intuitive Introduction: The Molecular Lock-and-Key Problem

Imagine the human body as a vast city with billions of molecular "locks" (protein targets) and pharmaceutical companies designing molecular "keys" (drugs) to fit these locks. Some keys fit perfectly into specific locks, while others might partially fit multiple locks—this is the essence of drug-target interactions.

In physics, we often transform complex problems into simpler ones by finding the right representation. Here, we transform the drug discovery problem into a **shortest path problem** on a graph. Just as light travels the path of minimum time (Fermat's principle) and particles follow paths of stationary action (principle of least action), drugs can be thought of as seeking the "path of strongest binding" to their targets.

The brilliance lies in converting **binding affinity** (how strongly a drug binds to a target) into **distance**: strong binding becomes a short distance, weak binding becomes a long distance. This transformation—using the negative logarithm—is not arbitrary but deeply rooted in statistical mechanics, where binding energy relates logarithmically to probability: $E = -k_B T \ln(K_d)$.

## 🔄 Two Approaches: Generic vs Domain-Specific

This example demonstrates **BOTH** approaches for using OptimShortestPaths:

### **Approach 1: Generic Functions (Recommended for New Users)**
The example uses these domain-agnostic functions that work with ANY graph:
- `analyze_connectivity(graph, vertex)` - Analyze reachability from any vertex
- `calculate_distance_ratio(graph, src, target1, target2)` - Compare path distances (used for COX selectivity)
- `find_reachable_vertices(graph, source, max_distance)` - Find vertices within distance threshold
- `find_shortest_path(graph, source, target)` - Find optimal path between vertices

### **Approach 2: Domain-Specific Convenience Functions**
For pharmaceutical experts, the example also provides domain wrappers:
- `create_drug_target_network(drugs, targets, interactions)` - Build network with drug/target names
- `find_drug_target_paths(network, drug_name, target_name)` - Find pathways using familiar names
- `analyze_drug_connectivity(network, drug_name)` - Drug-specific connectivity metrics

**Both approaches give identical results!** The example explicitly shows this by computing COX selectivity using both the generic `calculate_distance_ratio()` function and domain-specific analysis, demonstrating they produce the same values.

## 📊 Mathematical Formulation

### Problem Definition

Given a set of drugs and molecular targets with known binding affinities, we seek to find the optimal drug-target interaction paths that minimize the "pharmacological distance."

### Mathematical Framework

Let us define:
- **$\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2, ..., d_n\}$**: Set of drug molecules
- **$\mathcal{T} = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_m\}$**: Set of molecular targets (proteins)
- **$\mathbf{A} \in [0,1]^{n \times m}$**: Binding affinity matrix where $A_{ij}$ represents the normalized binding affinity of drug $d_i$ to target $t_j$

### Graph Construction

We construct a directed graph $G = (V, E, w)$ where:

1. **Vertex set**: $V = \mathcal{D} \cup \mathcal{T}$ with $|V| = n + m$

2. **Edge set**: $E = \{(d_i, t_j) : A_{ij} > 0\}$

3. **Weight function**: 
   $$w(d_i, t_j) = -\ln(A_{ij})$$
   
   This logarithmic transformation has profound meaning:
   - As $A_{ij} \to 1$ (perfect binding), $w \to 0$ (zero distance)
   - As $A_{ij} \to 0$ (no binding), $w \to \infty$ (infinite distance)
   - The transformation linearizes multiplicative probabilities into additive distances

### The Optimization Problem

**Primary Objective**: For each drug-target pair $(d, t)$, find:

$$\pi^*(d,t) = \arg\min_{\pi \in \Pi(d,t)} \sum_{e \in \pi} w(e)$$

where $\Pi(d,t)$ is the set of all paths from drug $d$ to target $t$.

**Global Optimization**:
$$\min_{d,t} \text{dist}(d,t) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \text{dist}(d,t) = \text{shortest path distance in } G$$

### Key Pharmacological Metrics

#### 1. Drug-Target Distance
$$\text{dist}(d,t) = -\ln(\text{effective\_affinity}(d,t))$$

#### 2. COX-2/COX-1 Selectivity Ratio
For anti-inflammatory drugs:
$$\text{Selectivity}(d) = \exp[\text{dist}(d, \text{COX-1}) - \text{dist}(d, \text{COX-2})] = \frac{A_{d,\text{COX-2}}}{A_{d,\text{COX-1}}}$$

A ratio > 10 indicates COX-2 selectivity, reducing gastrointestinal side effects.

#### 3. Drug Connectivity Score
$$\text{Connectivity}(d) = \frac{|\{t \in \mathcal{T} : \text{dist}(d,t) < \infty\}|}{|\mathcal{T}|}$$

### The DMY Algorithm Application

The DMY (Duan-Mao-Yin) algorithm solves this single-source shortest path problem with breakthrough complexity $O(m \log^{2/3} n)$.

#### Core Algorithm Components

1. **Initialization**:
   $$\text{dist}[s] = 0, \quad \text{dist}[v] = \infty \text{ for all } v \neq s$$

2. **Recursive Layering** (DMY Innovation):
   - Partition vertices into blocks of size $k = \lceil |V|^{1/3} \rceil$
   - Apply BMSSP (Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path) with bound $k$
   - Process blocks recursively with frontier sparsification

3. **Frontier Sparsification**:
   - Select pivots from frontier $F$ with threshold $k$
   - Maintain complexity bound: $|F| \leq n^{2/3}$

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
   ```julia
   path = []
   v = target
   while parent[v] ≠ -1:
       prepend!(path, v)
       v = parent[v]
   return path
   ```

### Complexity Analysis

For pharmaceutical networks:
- **Vertices**: $O(n + m)$ where typically $n, m < 100$
- **Edges**: $O(nm)$ with typical sparsity ~20-30%
- **DMY Complexity**: $O(nm + (n+m)^{4/3})$
- **Dijkstra Complexity**: $O((nm + n + m) \log(n + m))$

**Theoretical Advantage**: DMY dominates when $nm < (n+m)^{4/3} \log(n+m)$

### Performance Note (CORRECTED)
⚠️ **Critical**: The k parameter must be set to n^(1/3) for correct performance. Using the shared benchmark data (`benchmark_results.txt`):
- n=200: DMY is **0.31×** the speed of Dijkstra (overhead dominates small graphs)
- n=500: DMY is **0.39×** Dijkstra (still warming up)
- n=2000: DMY is **1.77× faster** on sparse graphs
- n=5000: DMY is **~4.0× faster** on sparse graphs

## 🎯 Multi-Objective Extension

The example now includes **Pareto front analysis** for multi-objective optimization:
- **Objectives**: Efficacy, Toxicity, Cost, Time-to-Effect
- **Result**: 7 Pareto-optimal drug pathways identified (actual run results)
- **Insight**: No single "best" drug - choice depends on patient-specific priorities

## 🧪 Biological Interpretation

### The Physics-Chemistry Bridge

The negative logarithm transformation connects to fundamental thermodynamics:

$$\Delta G = -RT \ln(K_a) = RT \ln(K_d)$$

where:
- $\Delta G$: Gibbs free energy of binding
- $K_a = 1/K_d$: Association constant
- $R$: Universal gas constant
- $T$: Temperature

Our distance metric thus represents a normalized free energy barrier!

### Clinical Significance Thresholds

| Distance Range | Binding Strength | Clinical Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| $d < 0.2$ | Strong ($A > 0.82$) | High therapeutic effect |
| $0.2 \leq d < 1.0$ | Moderate ($0.37 < A \leq 0.82$) | Potential off-target effects |
| $d \geq 1.0$ | Weak ($A \leq 0.37$) | Minimal interaction |

## 💻 Setup and Installation

```bash
cd examples/drug_target_network
julia --project=. -e "using Pkg; Pkg.develop(path=\"../..\"); Pkg.instantiate()"
```

## 🚀 Running the Example

```bash
julia --project=. drug_target_network.jl
julia --project=. generate_figures.jl
```

## 📈 Example: Celecoxib Selectivity Analysis

### Given Data
- $A_{\text{Celecoxib,COX-2}} = 0.95$
- $A_{\text{Celecoxib,COX-1}} = 0.05$

### Calculation
$$\text{dist}(\text{Celecoxib}, \text{COX-2}) = -\ln(0.95) = 0.051$$
$$\text{dist}(\text{Celecoxib}, \text{COX-1}) = -\ln(0.05) = 2.996$$

$$\text{Selectivity} = \exp(2.996 - 0.051) = \exp(2.945) \approx 19.0$$

**Clinical Interpretation**: Celecoxib is 19× more selective for COX-2, explaining its reduced gastrointestinal toxicity compared to traditional NSAIDs.

## 🎯 Applications in Drug Discovery
