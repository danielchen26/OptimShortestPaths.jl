# OptimShortestPaths Framework Comprehensive Dashboard

## Optimization Problems Unified as Shortest-paths

*A framework for transforming optimization problems into graph shortest-path problems*

---

**Reproducibility**: All scripts accept `--seed=<int>` (or `OPTIM_SP_SEED=<int>`) to replay exact synthetic datasets and benchmarks. Default seed is `42`.

---

## Executive Summary

The DMY algorithm achieves O(m log^(2/3) n) complexity for directed single-source shortest paths with non-negative weights. On sparse graphs (m ≈ 2n):

- Break-even near 2,000 vertices: 1.77× faster than Dijkstra
- At 5,000 vertices: 4.79× faster than Dijkstra
- Sub-millisecond performance on practical problems

### Transformation Method

| Original Problem | Graph Representation | Solution Meaning |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| States/Configurations | Vertices | Points in solution space |
| Allowed Transitions | Edges | Valid moves or decisions |
| Transition Costs | Edge Weights | Cost of decisions |
| Constraints | Missing Edges | Invalid transitions |
| Multi-objective | Vector Weights | Pareto optimization |
| Optimal Solution | Shortest Path | Best decision sequence |
