# üåü OptimSPath Framework Comprehensive Dashboard

## Optimization Problems Unified as Shortest-paths

*A systematic framework for transforming optimization problems into graph shortest-path problems*

## üìö The OptimSPath Philosophy

OptimSPath provides a **systematic transformation framework** that converts optimization problems into shortest-path problems, enabling efficient solutions using the DMY algorithm with **O(m log^(2/3) n)** complexity.

### Key Transformation Principles

| **Original Problem** | **Graph Representation** | **Solution Meaning** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| States/Configurations | Vertices | Points in solution space |
| Allowed Transitions | Edges | Valid moves or decisions |
| Transition Costs | Edge Weights | Cost of decisions |
| Constraints | Missing Edges | Invalid transitions |
| Multi-objective | Vector Weights | Pareto optimization |
| Optimal Solution | Shortest Path | Best decision sequence |

## üéØ Problem Casting Methodology

OptimSPath provides a systematic 6-step approach to transform optimization problems:

![Problem Casting Methodology](figures/problem_casting_methodology.png)

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **IDENTIFY STATES** - Define problem configurations as vertices
2. **DEFINE TRANSITIONS** - Map valid moves as edges
3. **QUANTIFY COSTS** - Assign weights to transitions
4. **SPECIFY OBJECTIVES** - Determine optimization goals
5. **HANDLE CONSTRAINTS** - Remove invalid edges
6. **SOLVE & INTERPRET** - Find shortest path as solution
