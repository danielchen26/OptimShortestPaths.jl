# Treatment Protocol Optimization Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This dashboard presents comprehensive analysis of cancer treatment protocols using the DMY shortest-path algorithm, including both **single-objective** cost optimization and **multi-objective Pareto front** analysis balancing cost, time, quality of life, and success rates.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Single-objective**: Optimal curative pathway costs $29.2k with 5 treatment steps
2. **Multi-objective**: Multiple Pareto-optimal protocols discovered for different patient priorities
3. **Performance**: DMY achieves 4.79× speedup over Dijkstra at n=5000 protocols (k=⌈n^{1/3}⌉)

## Part 2: Multi-Objective Pareto Front Analysis

### The Challenge
Real-world treatment decisions involve optimizing multiple competing objectives:
- **Cost**: Financial burden on patient/system
- **Time**: Treatment duration and recovery
- **Quality of Life**: Side effects and patient comfort
- **Success Rate**: Probability of remission

### Figure 4: 2D Pareto Front Projections
![Pareto Front 2D](figures/treatment_pareto_2d.png)

**Four critical trade-offs visualized**:
1. **Cost vs Success**: More expensive treatments have higher success rates
2. **Time vs QoL**: Longer treatments impact quality of life
3. **Cost vs QoL**: Expensive treatments may preserve QoL better
4. **Speed vs Success**: Faster treatments may be less effective

### Figure 5: 3D Pareto Front Visualization
![Pareto Front 3D](figures/treatment_pareto_3d.png)

**3D Trade-off Space**:
- **X-axis (Cost)**: Treatment cost in thousands ($0-100k)
- **Y-axis (Success)**: Probability of remission (0-100%)
- **Z-axis (QoL)**: Quality of life score (0-100)

Special solutions highlighted:
- **Blue Star (Balanced)**: Optimizes all objectives equally
- **Green Diamond (Budget)**: Cost ≤$50k with >70% success
- **Red Hexagon (Knee)**: Optimal trade-off point

### Pareto-Optimal Treatment Protocols

| Protocol | Treatment Path | Cost | Time | QoL | Success | **When to Use** |
|----------|---------------|------|------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Surgery + Chemo | $62k | 14wk | 30 | 88% | **Young, fit patients** - Can tolerate aggressive treatment |
| 2 | Surgery Only | $37k | 54wk | 60 | 85% | **Localized disease** - Good prognosis with surgery alone |
| 3 | Radiation + Minor Surgery | $47k | 7wk | 55 | 88% | **Moderate risk** - Balance of approaches |
| 4 | Targeted Therapy | $47k | 60wk | 65 | 80% | **Biomarker positive** - Precision medicine |
| 5 | Immunotherapy | $42k | 68wk | 50 | 70% | **Advanced disease** - When standard fails |
| 6 | Chemo + Radiation | $57k | 64wk | 40 | 75% | **Inoperable** - Non-surgical candidates |
| 7 | Watch & Wait | $12k | 156wk | 75 | 60% | **Low risk** - Indolent disease |
| 8 | Palliative | $12k | 156wk | 75 | 60% | **End-stage** - Comfort care focus |

### Figure 6: Treatment Strategy Comparison
![Treatment Strategies](figures/treatment_strategies.png)

**Strategy Analysis**:
- **Surgery+Chemo**: Highest success (88%) but poor QoL (30)
- **Surgery Only**: Good balance (85% success, 60 QoL)
- **Watch&Wait**: Best QoL (75) but lower success (60%)
- **Targeted**: Best overall balance for eligible patients

## Part 3: Patient-Specific Protocol Selection

### Figure 7: Patient Profile Analysis
![Patient Profiles](figures/patient_profiles.png)

**Personalized Recommendations**:

| Patient Profile | Recommended Protocol | Cost | Success | QoL | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------------|------|---------|-----|-----------|
| Young, Healthy | Surgery + Chemo | $60k | 90% | 40 | Can tolerate aggressive treatment |
| Elderly, Frail | Minor Surgery Only | $25k | 70% | 75 | Prioritize quality of life |
| High Comorbidity | Targeted Therapy | $45k | 75% | 60 | Lower systemic toxicity |
| Limited Resources | Watch & Wait → Medical | $15k | 65% | 65 | Cost-effective escalation |
| Quality Focus | Immunotherapy | $40k | 72% | 85 | Minimize side effects |

### Figure 8: Clinical Decision Tree
![Decision Tree](figures/decision_tree.png)

**Decision Support Framework**:
1. **Initial Assessment**: Risk stratification
2. **High Risk**: Aggressive multimodal therapy
3. **Low Risk**: Conservative or single modality
4. **Resource Constraints**: Stepwise escalation
