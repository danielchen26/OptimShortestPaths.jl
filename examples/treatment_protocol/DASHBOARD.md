# Treatment Protocol Optimization Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This dashboard presents comprehensive analysis of cancer treatment protocols using the DMY shortest-path algorithm, including both **single-objective** cost optimization and **multi-objective Pareto front** analysis balancing cost, time, quality of life, and success rates.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Single-objective**: Optimal curative pathway costs $10.8k with 7 treatment steps (Initial Screening → Remission)
2. **Multi-objective**: Six Pareto-optimal protocols balance cost ($17.5k–$56k), duration (54–158 wk), QoL (5–52), and success (305–456 scaled units)
3. **Performance**: On the current 20-node protocol, DMY runs ~2.1× faster than Dijkstra (0.01 ms vs 0.03 ms)

**Reproducibility**: run `treatment_protocol.jl` or `generate_figures.jl` with `--seed=<int>` (or set `OPTIM_SP_SEED`) to replay the exact same simulated patient pathways. Default seed is `42`.

## Part 1: Single-Objective Analysis

### Figure 1: Treatment Cost vs Efficacy
![Treatment Cost Efficacy](figures/treatment_cost_efficacy.png)

**Interpretation**:
- Major surgery: Highest cost ($35k) with 90% efficacy
- Targeted therapy: Most expensive ($45k) with 80% efficacy
- Screening/Biopsy: Low cost, high diagnostic value
- Trade-off clearly visible between cost and treatment success

### Figure 2: Treatment Pathway Network
![Treatment Network](figures/treatment_network.png)

**Key Insights**:
- Left-to-right layout shows diagnostic intake → planning → consults → active therapy → follow-up
- Color coding separates Diagnostics, Planning, Specialist Consults, Active Treatment, and Follow-up & Support cohorts
- Arrow directions capture every valid transition from the simulation (e.g., recurrence loops back to second-line or palliative care)
- ⭐ Remission node is highlighted so reviewers can instantly identify terminal success states

### Figure 3: Risk-Benefit Analysis

**Clinical Significance**:

| Treatment | Risk | Benefit | Quadrant |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| Targeted | 15 | 80 | Low Risk, High Benefit ✓ |
| Immuno | 20 | 70 | Low Risk, High Benefit ✓ |
| Radiation | 25 | 85 | Moderate Risk, High Benefit |
| Surgery | 30 | 85 | High Risk, High Benefit |
| Chemo | 40 | 75 | High Risk, High Benefit |

## Part 2: Multi-Objective Pareto Front Analysis

### The Challenge
Real-world treatment decisions involve optimizing multiple competing objectives:
- **Cost**: Financial burden on patient/system
- **Time**: Treatment duration and recovery
- **Quality of Life**: Side effects and patient comfort
- **Success Rate**: Probability of remission

### Figure 4: 2D Pareto Front Projections
![Pareto Front 2D](figures/treatment_pareto_2d.png)

**Four critical trade-offs visualized**:
1. **Cost vs Success**: More expensive treatments have higher success rates
2. **Time vs QoL**: Longer treatments impact quality of life
3. **Cost vs QoL**: Expensive treatments may preserve QoL better
4. **Speed vs Success**: Faster treatments may be less effective

### Figure 5: 3D Pareto Front Visualization
![Pareto Front 3D](figures/treatment_pareto_3d.png)

**3D Trade-off Space**:
- **X-axis (Cost)**: Treatment cost in thousands (~$17–$56k across the Pareto set)
- **Y-axis (Success)**: Scaled remission score (305–456 composite units; higher is better)
- **Z-axis (QoL)**: Quality-of-life index (5–52; higher preserves comfort)

Legend highlights:
- **Green Diamond — “Budget-constrained”**: Pareto solution 2 ($17.5k, 158 wk, QoL 52, success ≈ 305) satisfies the cost ≤ $50k constraint.
- **Red Hexagon — “Knee Point”**: Pareto solution 6 ($56.0k, 60 wk, QoL 5, success ≈ 456) balances the frontier’s steepest trade-off.
- Weighted-sum scoring is intentionally omitted because the objectives mix min/max senses; convert maximise metrics to costs before re-enabling it.

### Pareto-Optimal Treatment Protocols

| Solution | Treatment Pattern | Cost | Time | QoL | Success* | **When to Use** |
|----------|-------------------|------|------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Diagnosis → Basic Imaging → Staging → … | $22.5k | 55 wk | 42 | 365 | **Balanced** – moderate cost, solid outcome |
| 2 | Diagnosis → Basic Imaging → Staging → … | $17.5k | 158 wk | 52 | 305 | **Budget-focused** – extend time to control cost |
| 3 | Diagnosis → Advanced Imaging → Staging → … | $26.0k | 54 wk | 40 | 373 | **Aggressive imaging** – faster staging, good success |
| 4 | Diagnosis → Advanced Imaging → Staging → … | $21.0k | 157 wk | 50 | 313 | **Cost-conscious imaging** – slightly slower, lower spend |
| 5 | Diagnosis → Basic Imaging → Staging → … | $52.5k | 61 wk | 7 | 448 | **High-intensity therapy** – prioritize success despite QoL hit |
| 6 | Diagnosis → Advanced Imaging → Staging → … | $56.0k | 60 wk | 5 | 456 | **Max success knee point** – resource-rich settings |

*Success values are scaled composite scores from the example model and can exceed 100.

### Figure 6: Treatment Strategy Comparison
![Treatment Strategies](figures/treatment_strategies.png)

**Strategy Analysis**:
- **Budget control** (Solution 2): $17.5k, success ≈305, QoL 52 – lowest spend, longest duration
- **Mid-range blend** (Solution 1): $22.5k, success ≈365, QoL 42 – balanced compromise
- **High-success knee** (Solution 6): $56.0k, success ≈456, QoL 5 – maximum remission at the expense of comfort
- Weighted-sum ranking requires converting efficacy to a cost; disabled by default to avoid misleading scores

## Part 3: Patient-Specific Protocol Selection

### Figure 7: Patient Profile Analysis
![Patient Profiles](figures/patient_profiles.png)

**Personalized Recommendations**:

| Patient Profile | Recommended Protocol | Cost | Success* | QoL | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------------|------|---------|-----|-----------|
| Young, fit | Solution 6 (High-success) | $56.0k | 456 | 5 | Maximize remission when tolerance for toxicity is high |
| Standard risk | Solution 1 (Balanced) | $22.5k | 365 | 42 | Strong remission with manageable QoL impact |
| Budget-limited | Solution 2 (Cost focus) | $17.5k | 305 | 52 | Lowest spend, accepts longer duration |
| QoL-priority | Solution 2 or 1 | $17.5k–$22.5k | 305–365 | 42–52 | Keeps QoL above 40 while maintaining efficacy |
| Salvage/advanced disease | Solution 5 (Aggressive) | $52.5k | 448 | 7 | Pursue high success despite severe QoL penalty |

*Success values are scaled composite scores from the example model.

### Figure 8: Clinical Decision Tree
![Decision Tree](figures/decision_tree.png)

**Decision Support Framework**:
1. **Initial Assessment**: Risk stratification
2. **High Risk**: Aggressive multimodal therapy
3. **Low Risk**: Conservative or single modality
4. **Resource Constraints**: Stepwise escalation

## Part 4: Algorithm Performance

### Figure 9: Corrected Performance Analysis
![Performance Analysis](figures/treatment_performance.png)

**Critical Fix**: k parameter corrected from k=n-1 to k=n^(1/3)

| Scenario | DMY runtime | Dijkstra runtime | **Speedup** |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Current 20-node protocol | 0.01 ms | 0.03 ms | **2.14×** |

**Key Insights**:
- Legend separates `DMY (k = n^{1/3})` and `Dijkstra`; vertical whiskers denote ±95% confidence intervals
- Even modest protocol graphs benefit from the DMY implementation
- Larger hospital libraries inherit the same O(m log^{2/3} n) advantage
- Lightweight runtimes enable real-time clinical decision support
